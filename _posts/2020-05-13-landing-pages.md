Dear engineer, don‚Äôt let them make you code a landing page from scratch. Whether it‚Äôs a hackathon project, a side project or a freelance gig. Do not give in. Just because you can, doesn‚Äôt mean you should. The project might not even need a landing page, could be bad prioritization? Then again, it‚Äôs not your place to say.

What you can do, is to convince your team to use a no-code tool like <a href="https://unicornplatform.com" target="_blank">Unicorn Platform</a> or <a href="https://webflow.com" target="_blank">Webflow</a>. If you fail doing so, they will use YOU as a no-code tool! üòÑ

Landing pages are 90% copy, 10% CSS animations. Meaning, there will be loads of things, that you couldn't care less about. Here‚Äôs how you convince every sane person to use a no-code platform.

1. **No infrastructure.** No VPS, Web server, SSL setup or maintenance.
2. **Secure.** It may introduce flaws but there's a team dealing with them that is not you.
3. **Ship fast.** If you‚Äôre not setting up sites every day, it will take you at the very least an hour. Whereas getting a site live on Webflow is like five clicks.
4. **Cheap.** Monthly cost of a no-code platform costs less than engineer‚Äôs hour.
5. **Fallback safety.** You can always get the static files and host them on your own.
6. **Easy to add improvements.** Others can do the changes as they see fit. Because it's easy.
   If you can code, you already know how to use these tools. At least Unicorn Platform or Webflow don't bring many new abstractions. You don't need to start learning a complex logic like you would with Wordpress.

Good luck fighting for your headspace
