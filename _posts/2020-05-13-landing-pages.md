Dear engineer, don‚Äôt let them make you code a landing page from scratch.

Whether it‚Äôs a hackathon project, a side project or a freelance gig. Do not give in. Just because you can, doesn‚Äôt mean you should. The project might not even need a landing page, it could be bad prioritization. Then again, it might not be your place to say.

What you want to do, is to convince your team to use a no-code supertool like <a href="https://unicornplatform.com" target="_blank">Unicorn Platform</a> or <a href="https://webflow.com" target="_blank">Webflow</a>. If you fail, they will use YOU as a no-code tool! üòÑ

Landing pages are 90% copy, 10% CSS animations. Meaning, there will be loads of things, that you couldn't care less about. Here‚Äôs how you convince every sane person to use a no-code platform.

1. **No infrastructure.** No VPS, web server, SSL setup or maintenance. That's already invaluable.
2. **Ship fast.** If you‚Äôre not setting up sites every day, it will take you at the very least an hour. Whereas getting a site live on Webflow is five clicks tops.
3. **Cheap.** Monthly cost of a no-code platform is less than engineer‚Äôs hour.
4. **Easy to add improvements.** Others can do the changes. Because it's easy. If you can code, you already know how to use these tools. Neither Unicorn Platform nor Webflow bring too many new abstractions.
5. **Almost no boilerplate.** The site is using best practices out of the box and has low bundle size.
6. **Fallback safety.** You can always get the static files and host them yourself.

That's it, good luck fighting for your headspace
