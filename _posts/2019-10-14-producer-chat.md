title: "Product Experiment: #1 Producer Chat"
---


About this time, a year ago I had just found the indie maker communities on the web. Studying music producing,
I came up with an idea to steal (phrasing.. ðŸ˜„) the "chat group + todo list" concept ([MakerLog](https://getmakerlog.com), [WIP Chat](https://wip.chat/))
and port it for beat makers, indie producers. 

Honestly, I knew nothing about music production so I decided to message this guy from an Udemy course.
