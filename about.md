Escaped LinkedIn and this is where I hide.

I run product experiments where I design, develop, market and sell myself. When I'm tired of that, I produce sunny, laid back good-vibe music ([my SoundCloud](https://soundcloud.com/pyta2)). Main point is I skip the bs and **make stuff**.

Hired as a software engineer for [Catapult Labs](http://catapultlabs.eu) which offers the work culture I stand for: remote, non-corporative environment, flexible schedule.
