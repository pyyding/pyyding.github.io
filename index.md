FACTS

Estonian.

Working as a developer from 2016. Began writing code in [AddGoals](https://addgoals.com) (a social network platform). I have done freelancing gigs for clients in Estonia, UK and US.

Now hired as a software engineer for [Catapult Labs](http://catapultlabs.eu) who provides nomad-friendly working culture: remote ok, non-corporative, flexible schedules.

Building stuff nobody uses wears me down so I try to avoid it or ask a lot of money for it.

I run product experiments as a hobby. First one was Producer Chat: a social platform for music producers.

When I'm not working, I play around with music: ([SoundCloud](https://soundcloud.com/jsprks)).

Resource efficient passionate small teams > funded, overcrowded start-ups
