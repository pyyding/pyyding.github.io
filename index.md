Estonian.

To make life less comfortable I go ice swimming weekly.

I have been working as a developer from 2016. Began writing code in [AddGoals](https://addgoals.com) (a social network platform) as a front-end developer, later became full-stack.  I have done a few freelancing gigs for clients in Estonia, UK and US.

Now hired as a software engineer for [Catapult Labs](http://catapultlabs.eu) who provides nomad-friendly work culture: remote ok, non-corporative, flexible schedules. I travel whenever I want *(read: plenty)*. Getting soaked in the destination's culture & vibe is why I travel.

Building stuff nobody uses feels like an ultimate waste of my resources — Kaspar gets paid but the universe gets nothing and that's bs. 

I run product experiments as a hobby. My first one was Producer Chat: a social platform for music producers. When I'm tired of coding, I produce grooves ([my SoundCloud](https://soundcloud.com/pyta2)).

Successful bootstrappers are who I look up to — resource efficient passionate small teams of experts can make unbelievable things.

My end-goal is everything I do professionally occupies the same headspace with what I want to do in my free time.

**"Room thoughts" I buy**

When there's no leader in the room, you're the leader. 

When there's a better leader than you in the room, let them lead.

When you're the smartest person in the room, go to a new room.
