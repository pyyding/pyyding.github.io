Got BSc in Business Information Technology in 2017 but have been working as a developer from 2016. Began writing code in [AddGoals](https://addgoals.com) (a social network platform) as a front-end developer, later became full-stack. Have done a couple freelancing gigs remotely outside from Estonia. 

Now hired as a software engineer for [Catapult Labs](http://catapultlabs.eu) who offers the work culture I stand for: remote-friendly, non-corporative, flexible schedules.

I run product experiments as a hobby. When I'm tired of that, I produce sunny, laid back, good-vibe music ([SoundCloud](https://soundcloud.com/pyta2)).
